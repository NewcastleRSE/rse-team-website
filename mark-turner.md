I aspire to be a mentally stable Bruce Wayne, or a humble Tony Stark; to become a hero in my own right by using my “super” knowledge and skills to create technology that improve lives.

I love to learn. I take every opportunity to add to my “Utility Belt” by researching new technologies and manufacturing methods. Equally, I love to teach. When the “robins” in my family want to build a self-driving car, or an elevator, I will stealthily appear. I gladly fed their curiosity by showing them the basics of sensors, actuators, programming and fabrication.

My ultimate purpose is to become a professional engineer, and leave innovative technology and knowledge for the future generations to inherit.
