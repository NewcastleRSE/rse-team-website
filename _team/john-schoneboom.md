John comes to the RSE Team from his previous gig at Newcastle University as a research software engineer for ECPPEC (Eighteenth Century Political Participation and Electoral Culture), where he developed the database that drives that website. He also works as a consultant for the New York State Department of Health, updating data on a monthly basis for their Health Profiles site, which allows end users to explore and compare quality data for hospitals, nursing homes, and other health care facilities.

John's also a published writer, with a novel (Fontoon) from Dedalus Books and a non-fiction work (Surrealpolitik) from Zer0 Books, and a playwright, with numerous plays performed mostly at Off Off Broadway venues. He occasionally teaches Creative Writing modules at Newcastle and/or Northumbria Universities. He likes his martial arts, has a special relationship with Latin American novelists, and can reliably hit 45 out of 50 free throws. He has lately taken an interest in playing guitar and hopes with diligent study to achieve mediocrity by some unspecified future point in time.
