Lorenzo joined the team in 2024. For the [XANESNET project](https://xanesnet.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), he implements neural networks to predict molecular structures. For computational fluid dynamics projects, Lorenzo manages codebases and datasets, provides advice on research best practices, and enhances simulations by integrating HDF5 libraries. He also contributed to MemoryChat, a chatbot for the detection of dementia designed to meet NHS standards.

Before joining the team, Lorenzo was a research scientist in computational and mathematical physics. He developed and implemented the [first method](https://journals.aps.org/prd/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevD.103.086006#fulltext) to simulate certain gravitational systems - such as black holes – in full generality. Through this method, he investigated [instabilities in rotating black holes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.14167) (see [videos of the simulations](https://www.youtube.com/@AsymptoticallyAdSevolutions)). Lorenzo also contributed to [GRFolres](https://doi.org/10.21105/joss.06369), a C++ code to simulate generalisations of Einstein’s general relativity.

Lorenzo began studying physics in 2011 at the University of Perugia, earning his Bachelor's and Master's degrees by 2016. Then, he moved to the University of Cambridge where he completed Part III Mathematical Tripos in 2017. Lorenzo obtained his Ph.D. with a [thesis on numerical relativity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.15329) from Queen Mary University of London in 2021, and stayed there as a research scientist for two years, before starting his current role at Newcastle University.
