Lorenzo joined the team in 2024. He works on implementing software engineering best practices in the context of fluid dynamics simulations carried out in high-performance computing (HPC) clusters by researchers in the School of Engineering.

Before joining the team, Lorenzo worked as a researcher in theoretical physics, specifically in numerical simulations of gravitational systems (such as black holes). He developed a numerical scheme able to simulate the fully general Cauchy evolution of asymptotically anti-de Sitter (AdS) spacetimes. He applied the scheme to simulate instabilities in rotating black holes, known as Kerr-AdS black holes. He analysed large amounts of data produced by the simulations and extracted relevant information that sheds light on gravitational phenomena. He also contributed to the development of another numerical relativity open-source code, called [GRChombo](https://www.grchombo.org).

Lorenzo's journey into physics started in 2011 at the University of Perugia (Italy), where he received his Bachelor’s degree (2014) and Master’s degree (2016). Then, he moved to the University of Cambridge (UK) to attend the Master’s program known as Part III of the Mathematical Tripos. After graduating (2017), he started his Ph.D. at Queen Mary University of London (QMUL). In 2021, he submitted his Ph.D. thesis in numerical relativity for asymptotically AdS spacetimes. He stayed at QMUL for a 2-year position as a researcher, before starting his current role as RSE at Newcastle University.
