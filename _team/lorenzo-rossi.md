Lorenzo joined the team in 2024. For the [XANESNET](https://xanesnet.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) project, he implements neural networks that predict the molecular structure of certain materials from their X-ray absorption spectrum (and viceversa). For another project, he implements software engineering best practices in the context of fluid dynamics simulations carried out in high-performance computing (HPC) clusters by researchers in the School of Engineering. He also contributed to MemoryChat, a chatbot for the detection of dementia designed to meet NHS standards.

Before joining the team, Lorenzo was a research scientist in theoretical physics, specifically numerical simulations of gravitational systems (such as black holes). He developed the [first numerical method](https://journals.aps.org/prd/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevD.103.086006#fulltext) able to simulate the evolution of these systems in anti-de Sitter (AdS) spacetime in full generality. Then, he implemented this method to [simulate instabilities in rotating black holes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.14167) (videos of his simulations can be found on [this YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@AsymptoticallyAdSevoluti-jc4cy)). As part of the [GRChombo organisation](https://www.grchombo.org), Lorenzo also contributed to another numerical relativity open-source C++ code, called [GRFolres](https://doi.org/10.21105/joss.06369), to simulate gravity theories that generalise Einstein’s general relativity.

Lorenzo's journey into physics started in 2011 at the University of Perugia (Italy), where he received his Bachelor’s degree (2014) and Master’s degree (2016). Then, he moved to the University of Cambridge (UK) to attend the Master’s program known as Part III of the Mathematical Tripos. After graduating (2017), he started his Ph.D. at Queen Mary University of London (QMUL). In 2021, he submitted his [Ph.D. thesis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.15329) in numerical relativity for asymptotically AdS spacetimes. He stayed at QMUL for a 2-year position as a researcher, before starting his current role as Research Software Engineer at Newcastle University.
