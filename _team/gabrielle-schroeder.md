Gabrielle Schroeder joined the team as a data scientist in September 2023. After undergraduate training in molecular biology and genetics, she transitioned to research in computational neuroscience as a PhD student and postdoctoral researcher at Newcastle University. Her work focused on developing pipelines and applying a variety of techniques, such as time series analysis and unsupervised learning, to analyse brain activity and clinical data.

As a member of the RSE team, Gabrielle has designed data analysis workflows on AWS and developed software for biomedical signal processing. She has also added skills in user interface/user experience design and developed graphical user interfaces for data analysis and visualisation. Her interests include data visualisation, software design, and medical research software.
