Reece joined the Research Software Engineering team in March 2023 while completing his masters in Computer Science at Newcastle University. His dissertation project was to develop a pathfinding algorithm visualiser that allowed users to interact and experiment with different pathfinding algorithms in the hope of furthering their understanding when paired with traditional academic methods.

Since joining the team Reece has worked on a full-stack web application, a native mobile application and has began to re-design and implement an existing full-stack system for an ongoing NHS Foundation Trust project.

Reece is soon to start training as a Software Carpentries Instructor.
