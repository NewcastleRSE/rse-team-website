Reece joined the Research Software Engineering team while completing his masters in Computer Science at Newcastle University. His dissertation project was to develop a pathfinding algorithm visualiser that allowed users to interact and experiment with different pathfinding algorithms in the hope of furthering their understanding when paired with traditional academic methods.

Since joining the team, Reece has worked on multiple mobile applications and full stack systems. 

He is currently developing a patient registry system which is being used by multiple medical research groups within the university. 

Reece is also developing a website and mobile application for OrQA, an organ transplant assessment tool.
