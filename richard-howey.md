Richard has a rich background working in different areas of Mathematics, Statistics and Computer Science. He completed his PhD in Pure Mathematics working in the field of functional analysis and after briefly working in the software industry, he worked in the field of Artificial Intelligence Planning at Durham and Strathclyde Universities. He developed extensions to the planning modelling language PDDL (Planning Domain Description Language) and plan validation tool, VAL, which is used extensively by the research community to develop new planning methodology and applications. He further developed his modelling skills working as a mathematical modeller in the field of Epidemiology at Edinburgh University with a focus on foot-and-mouth disease.

Prior to joining the RSE group he has worked for over 10 years within the School of Medicine at Newcastle University in the field of Statistical Genetics developing methods and software to analyse genetic and biological data. During this time he has also completed an MSc in Statistics (part-time).
