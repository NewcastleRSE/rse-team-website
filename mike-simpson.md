Dr Mike Simpson is a Research Software Engineer working for the RSE Team in the Digital Institute. He graduated with a BSc in Computing from Newcastle University in 2008, followed by an MSc in Computer Games Engineering in 2009. He worked as a Game Programmer at a local studio for two years before returning to the university to start his PhD in 2011. His thesis was titled "Real-time Simulation of Rail Vehicle Dynamics" and involved using software and development practices from the game industry to develop and evaluate real-time 3D engineering simulations.

Since joining the Digital Institute in 2016, he developed software applications for a number of research projects, including projects with the NHS and the Alan Turing Institute. He has presented his work at a number of events, incluing the international Blender conference in Amsterdam, the UK RSE Conference and the IEEE e-Science Conference in Aukland, NZ. 

His research interests include the application of games industry technologies for other applications - such as gamification in education and healthcare - as well as virtual simulation and data visualisation. He also has experience of 3D graphics, web development and software engineering in a range of programming languages. His other interests include Photoraphy and 3D modelling, as well as reading and writing fiction. He also runs a blog where he discusses issues ranging from Video Games to Mental Health.
