12/04/2023,Code Community,Internet of Things (IoT) - How to program a microcontroller,"An interactive, hands-on session with microcontrollers! This session follows on from the Introduction to IoT session we ran in January.",ARMB.2.49,https://forms.office.com/e/VA6CmiBxt3
10/05/2023,Code Community,Python Modules and Geodata,"Python modules and packages are used all the time. If you code in python, you probably use them in your research. Learn what a module is, why it is useful and how to create your own module.",HDB.1.14.PC,https://forms.office.com/e/8U1gffKAzK
07/06/2023,Code Community,GitHub Pages - Create your own module,This session will provide an overview of how to use GitHub Pages to create a free website,BSTC.2.40.PC,https://forms.office.com/e/8tD6AfDyUq
05/07/2023,Code Community,Colouring Cities - Project Talk,"A follow-up to the other version control/GitHub talks, showing off some of the other less-commonly-used features.",BSTC.2.40.PC,https://forms.office.com/e/KVVRQLg5Bb
16/08/2023,Code Community,Gotta go fast? Getting your code on HPC/Cloud,"In this talk I will cover the basics of what HPCs are and what they can do for you, including cloud based virtual machines. We will talk about what parallelisation is and look at the practicalities of what kind of code is suited to being run in parallel, as well as covering what resources are available for Newcastle University research students and how to access them.",ARMB.2.49,https://forms.office.com/e/kjG6rx6y4Z
21/03/2023,Training,Unix Shell,"The Unix shell has been around longer than most of its users have been alive. It has survived because it's a powerful tool that allows users to perform complex and powerful tasks, often with just a few keystrokes or lines of code. It helps users automate repetitive tasks and easily combine smaller tasks into larger, more powerful workflows.  Use of the shell is fundamental to a wide range of advanced computing tasks, including high-performance computing. These lessons will introduce you to this powerful tool.",KGVI.1.71B,https://nclrse-training.github.io/2023-03-21-NCL/
22/03/2023,Training,Version Control with Git,"Version control is the lab notebook of the digital world: it's what professionals use to keep track of what they've done and to collaborate with other people. Every large software development project relies on it, and most programmers use it for their small jobs as well. And it isn't just for software: books, papers, small data sets, and anything that changes over time or needs to be shared can and should be stored in a version control system.",MED.DENE,https://nclrse-training.github.io/2023-03-22-NCL/

11/04/2023,Training,Internet of Things (IoT) Workshop,"This is a hands-on workshop for novices, aiming to give learners a better understanding of what The Internet of Things is. As a researcher you might be interested to know whether IoT is something that could be of benefit to you in your research and we hope that this workshop might help you answer that question.",KGVI.1.71B,
