It has survived because it's a powerful tool that allows users to perform complex and powerful tasks often with just a few keystrokes or lines of code. It helps users automate repetitive tasks and easily combine smaller tasks into larger more powerful workflows. Use of the shell is fundamental to a wide range of advanced computing tasks including high-performance computing. These lessons will introduce you to this powerful tool.","PGRLL6.19","https://pretix.eu/ncl/2026-01-29-NCL/","https://nclrse-training.github.io/2026-01-29-NCL/"
