Bowen Li joined the team in October 2022. His background centres on computational modelling, including both theory
and application. He has many years experience in research software development. Li received his
PhD in 2017 working on the formal modelling and verification of complex evolving system (CES). 
Since then, he has been involved in several computational biology projects as Research Associate. 
During his RA career, Li was the main developer of open-source scientific software
[NUFEB](http://github.com/nufeb) (Massively parallel simulator for agent-based modelling of microbial systems);
[SONCraft](https://workcraft.org) (GUI-based platform for CES modelling and analysis); and
[mcSTACK](https://github.com/shelllbw/mcSTACK) (Probabilistic model checker for DNA nano-device model).
