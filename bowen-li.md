Bowen Li joined the team in October 2022 with the background in computational modelling, including both theory
and application. He has over 7 years experience in research software development. Li received his
PhD in 2017 working on the formal modelling and verification of complex evolving system (CES). 
Since then, he has been involved in three EPSRC-funded projects as Research Associate. 
During his career, Li was the developer of several open-source scientific software, including 
[NUFEB](http://github.com/nufeb) (Massively parallel simulator for agent-based modelling microbial systems);
[SONCraft](https://workcraft.org) (GUI-based platform for CES modelling and visualisation); and
[mcSTACK](https://github.com/shelllbw/mcSTACK) (Probabilistic model checker fo DNA nano-device system).
