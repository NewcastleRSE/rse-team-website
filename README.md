# RSE Team Website

## Editing 
To edit the details on your staff page, simply update `your-name.md` and commit. After a few minutes, the website will update automatically.

## Local Development

The site is a simple static HTML, CSS & JS site so any lightweight webserver can run it. Examples using NodeJS and Python are below.

```bash
npm install http-server -g
http-server -a localhost -p 80
```

```bash
python3 -m http.server
```
